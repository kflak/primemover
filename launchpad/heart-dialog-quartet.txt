In English?

Yes, in English. May I lay my heart at your feet?

Only if you don't make a mess on the floor.

My heart is clean.

We'll see about that...

I always wanted to go to space.

I still want to go to space.

OK. Empty your mind.

Done.

Done.

Done. We will need a ship. We will need training. We will need oxygen.

Of course.

We will need pigs.

Pigs?

We need pigs to feed the people. More pigs.

What about pig rights?

The pigs' rights are to grow, to develop, to be eaten by the people.

And why not to be fed with the people? 

We can skip the pigs.

People fed to people in order to grow, to develop, to be eaten by the other people.

Just like my grandmother used to say.

What else did your grandmother say?

Never stay out in the sunlight!

Hmmmm, lungs, livers, hearts...

My liver is light as a feather.

We will see about that.

Do we want to go to space?

Of course.

Do we know where to go?

I have no idea.

Is your mind still empty?

My stomach is empty.

Thank you. Your heart is clean. Prepare for take-off.

Will you miss somebody?

Probably. If I remember.

All engines are running.

Are we sure about that?

Of who and of what can I say: "I know that!" This heart within me I can 
feel, and I judge that it exists. This world I can touch, and I judge that it 
exists. There ends all my knowledge, and the rest is construction.

Camus.

Are you nervous?

Probably not.

Age and wisdom are not necessarily the same thing.

Like my grandmother said...
